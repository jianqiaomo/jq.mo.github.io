Welcome to Jianqiao Mo's Pages! 

I'm an PhD student at New York University, Electrical and Computer Engineering department.
My adviser is Prof. [Brandon Reagen](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brandon-reagen). 
I'm broadly interested in hardware accelerator, computer architecture, machine learning and security. 

My research focuses on faster privacy-preserving computation 
(or [secure multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation)).
Currently, I am working on designing accelerator for one of the cryptographic protocols, 
the [Garbled Circuits (GC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbled_circuit).

Before NYU, I got my bachelor's degree from Nanjing University where
I worked as a research intern at [ICAIS](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/ICAIS) lab 
advised by Prof. [Zhongfeng Wang](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/wzf/list.htm).

I can also share you some materials about GC if you are interested:
