Welcome to Jianqiao Mo's page! Please visit [Activities](https://jqmo.top/activities/) for the latest updates.

I'm an ECE PhD student at New York University ([BAAHL](https://wp.nyu.edu/baahl/)).
My adviser is [Brandon Reagen](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brandon-reagen). 
I also work with [Siddharth Garg](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/siddharth-garg).

**Key words**: computer architecture, hardware accelerator, cryptography, machine learning and security.

My research focuses on Hardware Acceleration for Cryptography, to finally advance end-to-end Data Privacy and Integrity.

### privacy-preserving computation for end-to-end Data Privacy

I am developing specialized hardware system to provide faster privacy-preserving computation 
(or [secure multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation)).

We developed accelerators for one of the cryptographic protocols (Garbled Circuits (GC) [1,2]).

It is useful for realizing "private inference" in machine learning.

### zero knowledge proof for Data Integrity

I am also working on hardware accelerator for zero knowledge proof (zkp).

It is useful for verifying the integrity of data, by proving the correctness of some computation, 
without revealing the data itself.

Before NYU, I got my bachelor's degree from Nanjing University where
I worked as a research intern advised by Prof. [Zhongfeng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=faC-qekAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
I was working on reducing cost of the deep neural networks by providing dynamic exit branches.
