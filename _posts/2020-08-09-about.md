Welcome to Jianqiao Mo's Pages! 

I was an undergraduate student in Nanjing University (graduate in July 2020). 
Now I am an incoming PhD student in New York University (Electrical & Computer Engineering) in Fall 2020. 
I am advised by [Prof. Brandon Reagen](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brandon-reagen).
