TL;DR:

Garble Circuit (GC) is a powerful technique for privacy-preserving computation (secure multi-party computation).

There are two types of GC: Boolean GC and arithmetic GC.
Recent [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58751-1_12) 
demonstrates efficient transformations between them (**BC**: bit composition, **BD**: bit decomposition).

We implement these transformations in the library, and profile the scenario to choose the optimal GC realization - given 
a user computation, either Boolean GC or mixed GC will be the most suitable choice.

- This library implements mixed Garbled Circuits (GC), i.e., transformations between Boolean and arithmetic GC without revealing plaintext values.

- The transformations include bit composition, where Boolean values are composed into CRT-arithmetic labels, and bit decomposition, which breaks CRT-arithmetic labels down into Boolean values. These methods allow for efficient and secure conversions between different types of GC, optimized for practical use in privacy-preserving computation.
