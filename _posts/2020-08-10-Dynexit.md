**Abstract**:
Early-exit is a kind of technique to terminate a pre-specified computation at an 
early stage depending on the input samples and has been introduced to reduce energy 
consumption for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Previous early-exit approaches suffered 
from the burden of manually tuning early-exit loss-weights to find a good trade-off 
between complexity reduction and system accuracy. In this work, we first propose DynExit, 
a dynamic loss-weight modification strategy for ResNets, which adaptively modifies the 
ratio of different exit branches and searches for a proper spot for both accuracy and 
cost. Then, an efficient hardware unit for early-exit branches is developed, which 
can be easily integrated to existing hardware architectures of DNNs to reduce average 
computing latency and energy cost. Experimental results show that the proposed DynExit 
strategy can reduce up to 43.6% FLOPS compared to the state-of-the-arts approaches. On 
the other hand, it is able to achieve 1.2% accuracy improvement over the existing 
end-to-end fixed loss-weight training scheme with comparable computation reduction ratio. 
The proposed hardware architecture for DynExit is evaluated on the platform of Xilinx 
Zynq-7000 ZC706 development board. Synthesis results demonstrate that the architecture 
can achieve high speed with low hardware complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this 
is the first hardware implementation for early-exit techniques used for DNNs in open 
literature.
