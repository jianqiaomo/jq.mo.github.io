## Jianqiao Mo 莫剑桥

Welcome to Jianqiao Mo(莫剑桥)'s Pages!

I was an undergraduate student in Nanjing University (graduate in July 2020). 
Now I am an incoming PhD student in New York University (Electrical & Computer Engineering) in Fall 2020. 
I am advised by [Prof. Brandon Reagen](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brandon-reagen). 

My interests include Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and computer hardware. 
I'm exploring the intersection of DNN models and the specific accelerators to reduce the energy cost and complexity.

    Dynamic Early-Exit Strategy for Deep Residual Networks”, *2019 IEEE Workshop
    on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)*, Oct 2019

    -   **Received Best Paper Award (the first prize)**

####Research experiences

**Lab of Integrated Circuits and Intelligent Systems** \| Nanjing University \|
Research Assistant

*Advisors: Professor Zhongfeng Wang, Associate Professor Jun Lin,* ESE of NJU

Digital IC design for short-read alignment in Next-Generation Sequencing: Jun
2018-Jan 2019

-   Simulated a backward search algorithm of Burrows–Wheeler Transform with C++

-   Proposed approach that saved the space required on hardware for implementing
    Backward Searching and demonstrated its feasibility

Research on Early Exit Mechanism of Deep Neural Network(DNN): Mar 2019-Present

-   Applied Early-Exit mechanism to some DNN models to accelerate inference,
    reduce latency and cut down energy cost

-   Applied a dynamic loss-weight modiﬁcation strategy for DNN to adaptively
    modify the ratios of different exit branches and find a trade-off between
    accuracy and cost

-   Achieved remarkable performance on CIFAR-100/ImageNet dataset: we achieved
    standard or better performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches
    at 43.6% FLOPs reduction

-   Developed a hardware architecture to speed up the dynamic Early-Exit
    Strategy, which was evaluated on Xilinx Zynq-7000 ZC706 development board

-   Paper accepted by 2019 IEEE SiPS (**Best Paper Award, the first prize**)

Electronics \| Captain Aug 2017

*Advisors: Associate Prof. Jianjun Zhuang, Associate Prof. Jian Gao,* ESE of NJU

-   Led a team in designing a Ball & Plate Apparatus based on PID fuzzy control
    system; apparatus lead the ball to some specific positions by adjusting the
    slope of the plate according to the coordinate of the ball captured by a
    camera

-   Designed the signal processor and PID control system on STM32-F107 chip
    microcomputer
