## Jianqiao 'Cambridge' Mo 莫剑桥

Welcome to Jianqiao Mo 's Pages!

I was an undergraduate student in Nanjing University (graduate in July 2020). 
Now I am an incoming PhD student in New York University (Electrical & Computer Engineering) in Fall 2020. 
I am advised by [Prof. Brandon Reagen](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brandon-reagen). 

My interests include Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and computer hardware. 
I'm exploring the intersection of DNN models and the specific accelerators to reduce the energy cost and complexity.

    1. Digital IC design for short-read alignment in Next-Generation Sequencing: _Jun
    2018-Jan 2019_
    
        -   Simulated a backward search algorithm of Burrows–Wheeler Transform with C++
        
        -   Proposed approach that saved the space required on hardware for implementing
            Backward Searching and demonstrated its feasibility
    
    2. Research on Early Exit Mechanism of Deep Neural Network(DNN): _Mar 2019-Mar 2020_
    
        -   Applied Early-Exit mechanism to some DNN models to accelerate inference,
            reduce latency and cut down energy cost
        
        -   Applied a dynamic loss-weight modiﬁcation strategy for DNN to adaptively
            modify the ratios of different exit branches and find a trade-off between
            accuracy and cost
        
        -   Achieved remarkable performance on CIFAR-100/ImageNet dataset: we achieved
            standard or better performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches
            at 43.6% FLOPs reduction
        
        -   Developed a hardware architecture to speed up the dynamic Early-Exit
            Strategy, which was evaluated on Xilinx Zynq-7000 ZC706 development board
        
        -   Paper accepted by 2019 IEEE SiPS (**Best Paper Award, the first prize**)
